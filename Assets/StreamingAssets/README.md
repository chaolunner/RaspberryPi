# UnityFramework - streamingassets folder part

Created by chaolun

**Comment : StreamingAssets** folder is very special, it must work under the **Assets** folder, So I had to split the framework into two parts for version management.

## Quick Start

- `$ git submodule add git@github.com:chaolunner/UnityFramework.git Assets/Plugins`
- `$ git submodule add git@github.com:chaolunner/UnityFrameworkStreamingAssets.git Assets/StreamingAssets`
